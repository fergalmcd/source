"WRUPLAYER_Info_Commentary" = "The original CHA2DS2 score score is the best validated clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and usually benign heart arrhythmia. It is used to determine the degree of anticoagulation therapy required, since AF can cause stasis of blood in the upper heart chambers, leading to the formation of a mural thrombus that can dislodge into the blood flow, reach the brain and cause a stroke. \n
However, in clinical use, the CHA2DS2 score has been superseded by the CHA2DS2-VASc score that gives a better stratification of low-risk patients.\n
The CHA2DS2-VASc score has been used in the new European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation.\n
The CHA2DS2-VASc score assigns points (0-9) depending on the presence or absence of co-morbidities. A score = 0 corresponds to a truly low risk, and thus the recommendation is to prescribe either aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy, but no antithrombotic therapy is preferred.\n
Stroke risk assessment should always include an assessment of bleeding risk. This can be done using validated bleeding risk scores, such as the HEMORR2HAGES or HAS-BLED scores. The latter is recommended in the ESC and Canadian guidelines. If the patient is taking warfarin, then knowledge of INR control is needed to assess the labile INR criterion in HAS-BLED; otherwise for a non-warfarin patient, this scores zero.";

In the case of the patient's age, below 65 scores 0, 65-75 years scores 1 and over 75 years scores 2. With regard to gender, male scores 0, female scores 1.";
